# Contributing to Goxel


## CLA

For the moment I ask every contributors to sign a CLA (contributor license
agreement) document that gives me the right to relicense the code under any
other license.

To sign the CLA you can either get the pdf and send me the signed version
by email, or contact me and I'll send you a link to a form that allows to sign
it online.

Link to the pdf:

- For individuals:
    https://guillaumechereau.github.io/goxel/cla/goxel-cla-individual.pdf

- For company:
    https://guillaumechereau.github.io/goxel/cla/goxel-cla-entity.pdf

You can send the signed documents to guillaume@noctua-software.com.
